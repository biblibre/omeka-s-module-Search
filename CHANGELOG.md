# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.17.0] - 2024-12-17

- Fix sort option label being empty
- Add a summary of the search query above the results (optional, disabled by
  default)

## [0.16.0] - 2024-10-25

### Breaking changes

- Search adapters are now entirely responsible for filtering out
  results that users cannot access.
  `Search\Query::setIsPublic` and `Search\Query::getIsPublic` methods, which
  were previously used for that purpose, are kept for user queries (for
  instance if a user want only private resources)

## [0.15.5] - 2024-10-04

- CSS: Prevent facet column to be shrinked
- Prevent type error when facet value is an integer

## [0.15.4] - 2024-05-15

- When indexing outside of UpdateIndex job, detach all entities that have been
  attached by the indexer, as they can cause weird bugs if not detached.
  For instance, a batch update adding a value could result in the same value
  added multiple times to the same resource

## [0.15.3] - 2024-02-21

- Standard form: be more lenient about DOM structure when adding a new filter
  or a new group of filters (this allow themes that override
  standard-match-group.phtml to wrap these buttons in other HTML elements)

## [0.15.2] - 2024-01-08

- Avoid "undefined variable $title" warning in resource-list.phtml
- Escape HTML in $title in resource-list.phtml

## [0.15.1] - 2024-01-03

- Fix order of search fields returned by
  Search\View\Helper\SearchForm::getAvailableSearchFields

## [0.15.0] - 2023-11-16

- Add highlighting support

## [0.14.0] - 2023-11-16

### Added

- Add proximity setting to add an input on search form to choose distance between terms.
- Change UI of search page configuration form for facet fields, sort fields and
  search fields to be more easily configurable and more "Omeka-like".
  Remove dependency on jQuery UI.
- Add "facet value renderers" (extensible by modules) that allow to show to
  users a value different from what is indexed.
  The new built-in facet value renderer allows to render a resource's title
  when only it's ID is indexed.
- Makes the standard search form easily extensible by breaking it into smaller
  parts, allowing modules to add new parts and allowing user to enable each
  part individually and arrange them in any order.

## [0.13.0] - 2023-06-23

### Changed

- Resources that are created or updated in batch are now indexed in batch.
  Previously each resource was indexed separately. It allows adapters to
  optimize the indexing process.
- Resources that are created or updated are now indexed in a background job in
  order to not slow down the request. Except when we are already in a
  background job or a script executed from command line. In that case resources
  are indexed immediately.
